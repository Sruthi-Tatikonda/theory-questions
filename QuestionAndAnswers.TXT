1. Difference between Abstraction and Interface?
A. Abstaction:
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.
Abstract Class:
We can create the Abstract class by using Abstract keyword before the class name. 
An abstract class can have both Abstract methods and Non-abstract methods that are a concrete class.
Abstract method:
The method which has only the declaration and not the implementation is called the abstract method and it has the keyword called abstract. 
Declarations ends with a semicolon.

Interface:
Multiple inheritance cannot be achieved in java. To overcome this problem Interface concept is introduced.
An interface is a template which has only method declarations and not the method implementation.
An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. 
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
Interface cannot be instantiated.
There are mainly three reasons to use interface. They are given below.
It is used to achieve abstraction.
By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
It can be used to achieve loose coupling.
Examples of interfaces in selenium are webdriver, TakeScreenShot, JavaScriptExecutor, WebElement.

Inheritance:
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties (methods and fields) and behaviors of a parent object.
When we inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. 
Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
Uses of Inheritance:
For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
For Code Reusability.
Existing class is known as Super class whereas the derived class is known as a sub class.
Inheritance is applicable for public and protected members only. Private members can’t be inherited.

2.What is encapsulation?
A) Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data (variables) together in a single unit.
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
 Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
Purpose of Encapsulation:
•	Protects the code from others.
•	Code maintainability.

All the classes in a framework are an example of Encapsulation. In POM classes, we declare the data members using @FindBy and 
initialization of data members will be done using Constructor to utilize those in methods.

3.Explain about synchronization in selenium?
A)Synchronization has a very vital role to play in automation. 
Code execution and application need to be in sync to perform the operation. 
If the application slows down for any reasons like network, heavy load, etc  then the code keeps on checking for the particular web element. 
If the code doesn't able to find that element it fails, by throwing exceptions like NoSuchElement, ElementNotVisible, etc.

so, it is our responsibility to maintain the synchronization during automation.
 In Selenium WebDriver, Synchronization can be divided into 2 types:

1.Unconditional

2.Conditional

1.Unconditional Synchronization 

This type of synchronization comes from Java language where we just specify the timeout limit. 
It pauses the code for particular time specified and then it starts to execute the next line of code.

wait();

thread.sleep();

As a parameter, we have to pass the timeout value. Values are default to milliseconds. 
For example, if want to wait for 10 seconds , we need to pass value as thread.sleep(10000). 
Unconditional synchronization is not advisable to use for automation as it just waits for the specified time even if it has found the web element.

2.Conditional Synchronization  

In conditional synchronization, conditions will be set along with the timeout limit. 
Code will wait for the specified time declared until the expected condition gets satisfied, then it executes the next line of code.

It is divided into 2 types:


i) Implicit wait

ii)Explicit wait

i)Implicit Wait - The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a “No Such Element Exception”. 
The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.

Syntax ->  driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
ii)Explicit Wait-
The Explicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for Expected Conditions or maximum time exceeded before throwing “ElementNotVisibleException” 
exception. It can be applied only for specified elements.It is recommended to use when the elements are taking long time to load and also for verifying 
the property of the element like(visibilityOfElementLocated, elementToBeClickable,elementToBeSelected). 
Syntax -> WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,10)
		wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath()).click();
Explicit wait is used to wait for particular Web element, whereas Implicit wait will be used to wait for whole Web Elements in the driver instance.

4) Difference between throw and throws?
A) Throws clause is used to declare an exception, which means it works similar to the try-catch block. 
Throw keyword is used in the method body to throw an exception, while throws is used in method signature to declare the exceptions 
that can occur in the statements present in the method.

6) Method to get the page title?
A) driver.getTitle();

7)How to handle multiple windows on browser?
A) A window handle is a unique identifier that holds the address of all the windows.
 It is a pointer to a window, which returns the string value. This window handle function helps to grt the handles of all the windows
 and each browser will have a unique window handle.
 		Set<String> s = driver.getWindowHandles();
		Iterator<String> i = s.iterator();
		String parent = i.next();
		String child = i.next();
		System.out.println(driver.getTitle());
		driver.switchTo().window(child);
		System.out.println(driver.getTitle());
		driver.close();
		driver.switchTo().window(parent);

8)Explain about page object model in selenium?
A) Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern used in test automation which creates Object Repository for web elements.
 The advantage of the model is that it reduces code duplication and improves test maintenance.
Under this model, for each web page in the application, there should be a corresponding Page Class.
 This Page class will identify the WebElements of that web page and also contains Page methods which perform operations on those WebElements.
 Name of these methods must be given as per the task they are performing.

9)Difference between submit and click in selenium?
A)The click() and submit() functions are similar in terms of functionalities.some differences between them are

The submit() function is applicable only for <form> and makes handling of form easier. It can be used with any element inside a form. 
The click() is only applicable to buttons with type submit in a form.

The submit() function will wait for the page to load but the click() waits only if any explicit wait condition is provided. 
If a form has a submit of type button, the submit() method cannot be used. Also, if a button is outside <form>, then submit() will not work.

Thus we see that click() works for both type buttons irrespective of the fact that the button is inside or outside of <form>.
